{"addHeader":{"header":"About us:What is FTC Robotics and our Regal Robotics Team?"},"addTitle":{"title":"The First Tech Challenge is a competition between different robotics teams across the globe, split across different leagues and districts. In this competition, the teamwork, ingenuity, innovation, and the creativity of these different teams are pitted against each other as every team struggles to put together a robot that completes a variety of tasks in time before they face off against other teams. <br>Our team was created in 2023 in time for the Powerplay season from 2023-2024. We started out with very little other than the knowledge of the others in our school robotics club, a driving station, some old spare tools from other teams in our school, and a drivertrain kit from goBilda. Starting with what we started with, we did not do terrible, but instead peaked at 4th place in our regional competition. We hope to do even better starting in the 2024-2025 season starting with the creation of this very website! Not only do we hope to do better this season but to be able to preserve as much knowledge and experience as possible through the documentation on this website and through our our school-wide robotics club and this junior team.","attrs":{"class":"content about-us-content"}}}
